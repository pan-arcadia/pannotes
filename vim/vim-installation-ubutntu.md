# How to Install Vim on Ubuntu 

We can install Vim on Ubuntu with the following terminal command:

```shell
sudo apt install vim
```

This issue with this approach is that we may not get the latest version of Vim. We will get the latest version available in Ubuntu's repositories.

## Install Latest Version of Vim using PPA

We can install the latest version of Vim with the following terminal command:

```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/vim
sudo apt update
```

Now we can run the following command to install the latest version of Vim offered by the PPA:

```shell
sudo apt install vim
```
